# Tool for Conversational Topic Modeling
A tool that deaf people can use in their day to day life to join in conversations easily between other individuals. They now use speech-to-text tools to understand what other people are talking about. But the performance of these models are usually not good, especially for Bangla.

So it is hard for them to keep track of the conversations. So in this work, we propose a tool that will highlight conversational topics from the speech-to-text data. This would help deaf individuals easily keep track of the conversations happening.
